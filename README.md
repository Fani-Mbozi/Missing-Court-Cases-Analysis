# Missing-Court-Cases-Analysis
A research assistant project, where the goal was to identify court case filings that might be missing in our web-scrapped dataset. 
I have concised outlined the data wrangling process for this task on a GitHub page (created using R-markdown!) [linked here](https://fani-mbozi.github.io/Missing-Court-Cases-Analysis/).
