# Missing-Court-Cases-Analysis
This was a research assistant project, where the goal was to identify court case documents that might be missing from our web-scrapped dataset of all recorded Kenyan court cases. My job was to use the existing data to identify these gaps as an important data quality measure. 

I have concisely outlined the data wrangling process for this task on a GitHub page (created using R-markdown!) [linked here](https://fani-mbozi.github.io/Missing-Court-Cases-Analysis/).
