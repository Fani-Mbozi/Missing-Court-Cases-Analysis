## Introduction

Kenyan legal documentation on criminal appeal cases have been made publically accessible online and are presented in a standardised format that includes key details including the unique court case number (in the numeric sequence of court cases each year) for every year (1997-2017) and for 28 district courts. An example of can be found here: [link](http://kenyalaw.org/caselaw/cases/view/97059).

These relevant court details were compiled to create database that looks like the following:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=T, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(head(data, 4))
```

**Objectives**

Firstly, *sorting* all of the criminal appeals *by year and district*. And secondly, creating a dataframe that identifies missing cases in the numerated sequence of court appeals for each year and court station district. The final output would look like the below dataframe:  

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=T, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
head(final, 5)
```


## OVERVIEW OF KEY STEPS AND PROCESS 

1. Create a new `year` variable using the years from the criminal appeal statement. e.g. "Criminal Appeal 78 of `2013`". 
2. Create a `case number` variable by isolating the appeal number in the criminal appeal statement e.g. this is `78` in the statement "Criminal Appeal `78` of 2013".
3. Put the new 'year' and 'case number' variables in a new dataframe along with the relevant court district. 
4. Use this new dataframe to create a loop that sorts thorugh each district and year to check if there are missing case numbers and form the 'exists' variable. 

<br>

**PROCESS**
```{r, echo = F, eval=T, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r, echo = F, eval=T}

#Removing the non-digit elements of string so that we get only the 'case' and 'year' numbers.
data$clean<-gsub("\\D+", " ", data$Case.Number)

#Triming the String:
data$clean<-str_squish(data$clean)

#Separating the 'case' and 'year' elements. 
data$clean<-str_split(data$clean," ")

# Creating the year column
data$year<-lapply(data$clean,tail,1)

#Unlisting the year column
data$year<-as.numeric(unlist(data$year))

```

**STEP 1: Addressing the issue of missing years**

While there is a year variable called 'case_no_year' in the original dataframe, a lot of it's entries are missing (NA's), which would be a problem when trying to sort the appeals by year in future steps. To resolve this I firstly create a column in the dataframe called `clean` that extracts all the numbers from the criminal appeal statement. Secondly I create the needed `year` column using the *tail* (last) items of the `clean` column, which are almost always the appeal year. 

I can do this because all the criminal appeal statements follow the format: "criminal appeal `specific case number` of `specific year of appeal`". 

*Below is a preview of the `clean` column. The new `year` variable is just the last element of everything in the `clean` column.*
```{r, echo = F, eval=T}
head(data$clean, 2)
```


**STEP 2: Creating a 'Cases' variable.** 
This provides the unique sequential numbers that the cases for each district and years were labeled with. Going back to the criminal appeal statements, I first I remove all the year-related digits, and then extract the remaining case-related digits into a separate column. 



```{r, echo = F, eval=T}

data$Case.Number = str_replace_all(data$Case.Number,"(19|20)[0-9][0-9]", " " )
data$Case.Number = str_replace(data$Case.Number," (19|20)[0-9][0-9]", " " )
data$Case.Number = str_replace(data$Case.Number,"(19|20)[0-9][0-9] ", " " )
```


```{r, echo = F, eval=T}
#remove anomolies from string
data$Case.Number = str_replace(data$Case.Number," (0)[1-9]$", " " )
```

```{r, echo = F, eval=T}
# create case column 
data$case = str_extract_all(data$Case.Number ,"[:digit:]{1,}")
```

```{r, echo = F, eval=T}
head(data$case, 3)
```

<br>

**Challenge 1:** While the extraction methods use in Steps 1 and 2 were mostly efficient, there are some criminal appeal statements that do not follow that standard format of: "criminal appeal `specific case number` of `specific year of appeal`".

To illustrate this problem below are examples of four anomalous formats of the criminal appeal statements that I had to resolve:

```{r, echo=T, eval=T}

#Compound appeal statements that use special characters.
head(data$Case.Number[str_detect(data$Case.Number, ".*&.*&")], 3)

#Compound appeal statements that use 'of' multiple times. 
head(data$Case.Number[str_detect(data$Case.Number, ".*of.*of")], 3)
```

```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
#Truncated appeal statements
head(data$Case.Number[str_detect(data$Case.Number, "-")],3)
```

```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
#Renamed appeal statements that containing 'formerly' and a second set of case numbers
head(data$Case.Number[str_detect(data$Case.Number, "(?<=formerly).")], 3)
```

<br>

**Solution**: I used a combination of string manipulation (using regex) and manual editing to resolve each instance of anomalous appeal statements. The goal was to collect all the listed case numbers in the criminal appeal statements so that we had the best picture of which court cases we had (in the dataset) for each year of court data. The cleaned version of this case variable is previewed below, where appeal statements with many case numbers have those numbers truncated into a list. 

```{r, echo = F, eval=T}
clean_data = readRDS("cleaned_data.rds")
```

```{r, echo = F, eval=T}
clean_data$case[65:70]
```

```{r, echo = F, eval=T}
f_output<-data.frame(court.station=clean_data$county)
f_output$court.station<-str_to_upper(f_output$court.station)
```

```{r, echo = F, eval=T}
#extract case no. to output
f_output$case.number<-clean_data$case
```

```{r, echo = F, eval=T}
#extract year to output
f_output$year<-clean_data$year
```

**Step 3: Creating a draft 'output' dataframe with only court station, case number and year.**  

Now that I had the cleanest version of case number and case year from the original data, I create an intermediate dataframe, subseting only the information that would be needed for the function that creates the final desired final dataset. The intermediate dataframe is built from the newly created `year` and `case number` variables and the previously available `county` variable:

```{r, echo = F, eval=T}
head(f_output, 7)
```
<br>

**Challenge 2**. Even in this cleaner dataset, there are anomalous entries. This is especially true in the case of the extracted year values. To investigate the types of issues that were present in the intermediate dataframe. I first checked the `year` column for anomolies that have less than or more than a standard 4 digit value for `year`. This is exemplified by the findings below and resolved using simple string manipulation.

```{r, echo = T, eval=T}
f_output$year[str_detect(f_output$year, "^(0)[1-9]")] 
```

```{r, echo = T, eval=T}

#fixing years with -"02", "04" etc 
f_output$year[str_detect(f_output$year, "^(0)[1-9]")] <- paste0("20",f_output$year[str_detect(f_output$year, "^(0)[1-9]")])

#fixing years with - "16" and "13"
f_output$year[str_detect(f_output$year, "^(1)[1-9]$")] <- paste0("20",f_output$year[str_detect(f_output$year, "^(1)[1-9]$")])
```

Other examples of the code used to identify anomalous `year` values:
```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
f_output$year[str_detect(f_output$year, "^[:digit:]{1}$")] # One digit year error
# Two digit year error  : f_output$year[str_detect(f_output$year, "^[:digit:]{2}$")] 
# Three digit year error: f_output$year[str_detect(f_output$year, "^[:digit:]{3}$")]
```


```{r, echo = F, eval=F}

#Edit Codes (2-digit dates)
f_output[1351 , 3] = 2007 #1 EMBU
f_output[1351,] #check

f_output[1707, 3] = 2008 #2 Mombassa
f_output[1707,]

f_output[1834, 3] = 2005 #3 EMBU
f_output[1834,]

f_output[1843, 3] = 2006 #4 KAKAMEGA
f_output[1843,]

f_output[1852, 3] = 2008 #5 Mombassa
f_output[1852,]

f_output[1880, 3] = 2008 #6 Mombassa
f_output[1880,]

#Edit Codes (3-digit dates)

f_output[825 , 3] = 2005 #1 EMBU
f_output[825,] 

#Problem: There is mix-up with the case numbers and years for the below observation. For the time being I allocated this row to have year == '9' so that I could fix it when addressing other rows with single digit year values. 

f_output[1626 , 3] = 9 #2 NAIROBI: year
f_output[1626,] 

f_output[1777 , 3] = 2006 #3 MOMBASA
f_output[1777,] 

f_output[1845 , 3] = 2005 #4 NYERI         
f_output[1845,]

f_output[1971 , 3] = 2007 #5 MOMBASA                  
f_output[1971,]

#Problem: (the online document itself has no full input for the actual year)
f_output[4880 , 3] = NA #6 EMBUA                  
f_output[4880,]

#Edit Codes (1-digit dates: the easy fixes)

f_output[493 , 3] = 2004 #1 BUNGOMA                         
f_output[493,]

f_output[1871 , 3] = 2008  # KAKAMEGA                             
f_output[1871,]
```
<br>
**Step 4: Un-nesting:** This was a crucial intermediate step that allowed me to reshape my multi-number `case` variables into long-form data (i.e. having an individual row for each court case that was part of a combined appeal statement - so far combined cases have been stored in lists like the one below). 

```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
f_output$case[70]
```
This was done using the function **unnest**. This step is important because creating an individual row for every case allows me to iterate through the entire dataset to look for gaps in the sequence of case numbers. 
 
```{r, echo = T, eval=T}
#Unnesting final data set.
F_output = unnest(f_output, case.number)
```
<br>

**Step 4: Loop to check for missing cases:**  The final step is to create a nested for loop that checks the sequence of the case numbers for every district in every year to identify gaps. The function below does just that and I outline each step of what the loop is doing for clarity. 
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=T}
#CONVERTING YEAR AND CASE INTO NUMBERS 
F_output$case.number = as.numeric(F_output$case.number)
F_output$year = as.numeric(F_output$year)

#LOOP CREATING THE 'EXISTS' COLUMN 

final_data = list()
for(court in unique(F_output$court.station)){                           #looping through districts in F_output
  court_output = subset(F_output, str_detect(F_output$court.station, court))    #assigning a district label
  for(yr in unique(court_output$year)[!is.na(unique(court_output$year))]){      #looping through each year 
    court_year_output = subset(court_output, year == yr)                        #assigning a year label
    
    L3 = 1:max(court_year_output$case.number) #find the maximum value case number for the given year in the given district and count sequentially from 1 to that maximum.      
    
    L1 = rep(court, length(L3))  #attach the district label to each counted item                            
    L2 = rep(yr, length(L3))     #attach the year label to each counted item
    
    L4 = L3 %in% court_year_output$case.number #check if the sequential list of court cases (L3) is contained within my intermediate data frame (f_output) for the given year and district. Create a new variable with this check.
    
    final_data[[paste0(court, yr)]] = data.frame(L1,L2,L3,L4)                   #combine all function outputs  
  }
}

Final_thing = dplyr::bind_rows(final_data)

#RENAMING VARIABLES 
colnames(Final_thing)[1] <- "court.station"
colnames(Final_thing)[2] <- "year"
colnames(Final_thing)[3] <- "case.number"
colnames(Final_thing)[4] <- "exists"

#TURNING LOGICAL INTO 0/1 VALUES
Final_thing$exists = as.numeric(Final_thing$exists)
```
